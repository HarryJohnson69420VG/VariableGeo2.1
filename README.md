Variable Geo 2.1 (PC-9801) 1996, Giga/TGL
Repackaged version as an XDelta file by Harry Johnson (HarryJohnson69420)
The original files were uploaded by Will.Broke.It on from the PC-9800 Series Central Discord server, along with the updated sound drivers for the game

CONTENT WARNING
THIS GAME CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT! The content is the same as in the original V.G. 2
Noncon 
Watersports (It's urine for sure this time!)
Bondage/BDSM  
Sexual Humiliation
Tears and other generally unplesant H imagery.
(Thankfully there's no blood in the H scenes this time around)
PLAYER DISCRETION IS HIGHLY ADVISED! THIS GAME HAS CONTENT THAT CAN BE VERY TRIGGERING TO SOME PLAYERS! I'm aware that the original game had the option to remove the H content by turning the "GRAPHIC" setting off in the Options menu, but it removes the character intros before each match.

This is an official update patch of the 1994 game, Variable Geo 2 for the NEC-9801 by Giga/TGL sometime in 1996 and it was originally included in the V.G. Perfect Collection CD-ROM. This isn't just a minor bug fix patch. It completely changes a lot of the gameplay mechanics.
